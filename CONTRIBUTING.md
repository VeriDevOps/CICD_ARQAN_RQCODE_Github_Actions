## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Security Requirement Analysis GitHub Action Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to abide by its terms. Please report unacceptable behavior to [r.talalaeva@innopolis.university](mailto:r.talalaeva@innopolis.university).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting and Fixing Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/VeriDevOps/security-requirement-analysis/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/VeriDevOps/security-requirement-analysis/issues/new/choose) and choose `Bug report` type. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **workflow code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected and actual behavior.

- Fix bug and [submit a PR](#submitting-a-pull-request).

### New Features

1. Suggest your change via [opening a new issue](https://github.com/VeriDevOps/security-requirement-analysis/issues/new/choose) and choose `Feature request` type.

2. Implement a new feature and [submit a PR](#submitting-a-pull-request), after acceptance through Issue.

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. [Fork](https://github.com/VeriDevOps/security-requirement-analysis/fork) and clone the repository.
2. Configure and install the dependencies:
   1. In the project we use **Node v16.14.0** with **npm v8.3.1**. Use [nvm tool](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily control different versions of Node. Or install [manually](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/).
   2. Install dependencies via: `npm install`.
3. Make your change to the code under `src/` folder. Try preserve the structure:
   | File name | Description|
   | --- | --- |
   | [index.ts](https://github.com/VeriDevOps/security-requirement-analysis/blob/main/src/index.ts)| It is a main file. It has a function `run()` that is responsible for the whole action.
   | [apiService.ts](https://github.com/VeriDevOps/security-requirement-analysis/blob/main/src/apiService.ts)| Contains functions that are responsible to make API calls to ARQAN model or other services outside the GitHub. |
   | [github.ts](https://github.com/VeriDevOps/security-requirement-analysis/blob/main/src/github.ts) | Contains functions that are working with github context. |
   | [interfaces.ts](https://github.com/VeriDevOps/security-requirement-analysis/blob/main/src/interfaces.ts) | Contains all interfaces that are used in the code. |
   | [requirement.ts](https://github.com/VeriDevOps/security-requirement-analysis/blob/main/src/requirement.ts) | Contains all logic that is connected with classification Issue as a requirement and suggestion appropriate STIGs to it. |
   | [rqcode.ts](https://github.com/VeriDevOps/security-requirement-analysis/blob/main/src/rqcode.ts) | Contains all logic that is connected with [VDO-Patterns](https://github.com/anaumchev/VDO-Patterns.git) repository: searching test cases for the list of STIGs, commenting about found tests, opening issues in [VDO-Patterns](https://github.com/anaumchev/VDO-Patterns.git) and commenting about opened issues. |

   **NOTE**: If you add another file for covering your logic, update the table above accordingly, please.

4. If you added new input or output for the action, make sure you have updated the [action.yml](https://github.com/VeriDevOps/security-requirement-analysis/blob/main/action.yml). See the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions).
5. Build your code with `npm run prettier && npm run build`.
6. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/veridevops/security-requirement-analysis/compare). Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem/new feature and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
7. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
